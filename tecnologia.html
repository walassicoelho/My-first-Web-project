            <h1>Technology of the moment</h1>
            <h2>Drones as delivery method</h2>
            <p>Currently the biggest problem for drones to finally start delivering is legislation, but the futurist
                points out that by 2018 they will be used for hospital deliveries, for example. However, he says that
                this type of service will not be widely used for many tasks, such as pizza delivery, for example.</p>
            <h2>Hyperloop trips will be possible</h2>
            <p>We saw that Hyperloop One, Elon Musk's supersonic train, is already being produced and tested in the
                United States. Pearson says that in five or six years we will be able to see this type of system working
                to transport people between cities.</p>
            <p>It seems that fiction films are really starting to happen.</p>
            <h2>The advance of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Machines like those depicted in the film “Ex-Maquina” - with their own conscience - for example, could be
                a reality in 2025. The futurist explained that it is quite feasible that computers gain this
                characteristic if not in 2025 even earlier, in 2020.</p>
            <p>"Google DeepMind is not there yet, but I am sure that along the way, around 2020, your computers will
                become superhuman and end up being aware," he said. "That would be the beginning of the end, literally."
            </p>
            <h2>Spaceships to Mars</h2>
            <p>While people are already preparing for a return trip to Mars, Ian Pearson points out that in 2030 trips
                to the red planet will already be possible. This is also a good sign for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who wants
                to send people there in 2024.</p>
            <p>"First we will see some people going to Mars, then robots will make some materials [on the planet]," said
                Pearson.</p>
            <h2>Prosthetics will give humans new skills</h2>
            <p>The production of prostheses will be so good and advanced in ten years that they can really give people
                “new skills”. This year, James Young, a young scientific biologist in London, aged just 25, added a
                drone to his prosthetic arm.</p>
            <p>So, a decade from now, Pearson says that the prostheses will be so advanced that people will feel quite
                comfortable in joining technology to their own body. He gave an example that people can choose to have a
                cybernetic implant that makes their legs stronger.</p>
            <h2>Clothes with superhuman powers</h2>
            <p>Also in a 10-year survey, the futurist says he can see that the clothes may give new characteristics to
                people, suggesting that there will be leggings like pants that will make the acts of running or walking
                easier. Another suggestion of this visionary is that a costume similar to that of spiderman, with gel
                polymers that increase strength, is created by this time.</p>
            <h2>Houses built with 3D printers</h2>
            <p>If he is right it is a very good idea. Some architects around the world have already started projects
                along the same lines. In China, a company called Winsun claimed to have built 10 houses using 3D
                technology in just one day - each costing just $ 5,000.</p>
            <p>There is also the example of a professor at the University of South Carolina (USC) who is working on a
                giant 3D printer that can, in addition to building the house, add the plumbing and electrical parts.</p>
            <p>Ian Pearson says that this skill will become more and more usual as cities get more and more crowded.</p>
            <h2>Space tours in 2050</h2>
            <p>Before the joy is general, this type of pass will be something doable, yes, but only for the very rich.
                He said that space tourism will be leveraged, and stressed that projects like Space X and Blue Origin
                are a demonstration of that.</p>
            <p>"If the person can afford to pay 100 million, he can spend a week in orbit (...) but only for very
                wealthy people in 2050" He says that it will not be cheap at any time.</p>
