            <h1>Cyberpunk 2077</h1>
            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 should be one of the great games of this year, scheduled to launch in September 2020,
                after the announcement of the postponement, and with great expectations among fans and the market. It is
                a great game, from CD Projekt RED, the same as The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and Gwen The Witcher Card Game.
            </p>
            <p>Com Cyberpunk, o estúdio se afasta um pouco dos estilos que está acostumado em produzir, apesar de manter
                suas raízes no RPG. Além disso, a jogabilidade será em primeira pessoa na maior parte do tempo, mas isso
                não faz do game um FPS. Confira outras perguntas e respostas a respeito do lançamento de Cyberpunk 2077,
                a seguir.</p>

            <h2>What is Cyberpunk 2077?</h2>
            <p>The game is a futuristic adventure. It is an RPG with a large open world, which takes place inside the
                city of Mega City. The protagonist is known only as "V", with a look that can be personalized and will
                become unique. In addition, the game features the participation of actor Keanu Reeves in the role of
                Johny Silverhand, a character who should help the protagonist in some moments. Expect many scenarios
                with neon, technological weapons, hackers and other futuristic elements in a cyberpunk world.</p>
            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 will be a game with a focus on one player, but with some multiplayer elements. The title
                should have a vast campaign, with a lot of option to be done on the map, but without forgetting who
                prefers to follow the story.</p>

            <h2>What is Final Fantasy 7 Remake?</h2>
            <p>Announced during E3 2015, Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a reimagination of the acclaimed PlayStation One RPG.
                Unlike remakes that are more faithful to the source material, the Final Fantasy 7 remake is not just
                intended to recreate the original game exactly the way it was with improved graphics. The game tells the
                same story, but with totally new gameplay and elements that were not present in the PSOne version. The
                game's director, Tetsuya Nomura, has already confirmed that there are unpublished bosses, for example.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>O jogo se passa em um planeta semelhante à Terra chamado Gaia, que conta com uma força vital própria que
                é extraída pela empresa Shinra. A companhia transforma essa energia na substância "mako", que abastece
                tanto o progresso da civilização, como a cidade de Midgar, quanto planos ocultos da Shinra. Para impedir
                os danos causados pela extração, um grupo radical chamado Avalanche inicia uma luta armada contra a
                empresa. O protagonista da história é Cloud Strife, um antigo soldado do braço armado da Shinra,
                conhecido como Soldier, e atual mercenário contratado pela Avalanche.</p>
